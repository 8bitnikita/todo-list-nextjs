      I am a frontend React developer who completed an intensive program at
      it-incubator.io online school, which has equipped me with the necessary
      skills to build web applications. I like programming because you are
      constantly looking for solutions to non-trivial problems. Programming also
      provides opportunities for endless development, which only inspires me.
